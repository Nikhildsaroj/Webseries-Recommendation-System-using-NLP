# Webseries Recommendation System using NLP

### Description:
This repository houses a Webseries Recommendation System developed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to provide personalized recommendations for webseries based on user preferences and series descriptions. By analyzing textual data and user interactions, the recommendation system aims to assist users in discovering new and relevant webseries tailored to their interests.

### Key Details:
- **Dataset:** The dataset utilized in this project consists of metadata and user interaction data from 50,000 webseries. This includes series descriptions, ratings, reviews, and watch history.
- **Tasks:** The project encompasses various tasks such as data preprocessing, text analysis, and recommendation system implementation.
- **Techniques Used:** NLP techniques are employed for text processing and feature extraction, including tokenization, vectorization using methods like Count Vectorizer, and similarity measurement using techniques such as Cosine Similarity.

### Project Overview:
The project workflow commences with thorough data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Series descriptions undergo NLP analysis to extract meaningful features that encapsulate the essence of each webseries. Through the utilization of Count Vectorizer, textual descriptions are transformed into numerical representations, facilitating efficient comparison and similarity calculation using Cosine Similarity. The recommendation system utilizes these numerical representations to suggest webseries that closely align with the user's preferences, thereby facilitating personalized recommendations.

### Repository Contents:
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The primary notebook contains the Python code for data preprocessing, NLP analysis, and recommendation system implementation. It is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to guide users through the process.
- **Dataset File:** The dataset used for the project is included in the repository .


### Instructions:
To explore the Webseries Recommendation System and gain insights into the NLP techniques employed, clone this repository and execute the provided Jupyter Notebook. Before running the notebook, ensure that the dataset is properly located or downloaded from the provided source link.
